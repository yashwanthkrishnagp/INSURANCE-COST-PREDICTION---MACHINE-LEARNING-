🛡️ Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning
The main goal of this project is to predict insurance costs using various machine learning algorithms and compare their performance to determine which one gives the best results.

📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting medical insurance charges based on features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and region.
Multiple ML algorithms are trained, tested, and compared to find the most accurate model for prediction.

🛠 Tech Stack
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
Jupyter Notebook

⚡ Features
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Implementation of multiple ML models:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
naive bayes
